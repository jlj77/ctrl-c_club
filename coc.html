<h1>The Great Reset Matrix Community Code of Conduct</h1>
<p>Diversity is a great strength of any community, and <a href=
"https://matrix.to/#/#greatreset2020swef:matrix.org?via=matrix.org&amp;via=pettybickering.ca&amp;via=privacytools.io">
The Great Reset on Matrix</a> is no exception to this. (Remember,
the audience for our message is the very definition of diverse.)
However, it can also lead to communication issues and unhappiness.
To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to
adhere to. <em>This code applies equally to founders, mentors and
those seeking help and guidance</em>.</p>
<p>This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you can’t do.
Rather, take it in the spirit in which it’s intended - a guide to
make it easier to enrich all of us, and the wider world that we are
trying to motivate.</p>
<p>If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask
that you report it by:</p>
<ol>
<li>'at mentioning' the room administrator, jlj_
(@jlj:matrix.org); and, should they not respond promptly, by</li>
<li>sending an email to <a href="mailto:jlj@ctrl-c.club">the room
administrator</a>.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be friendly and patient.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Be welcoming.</strong> We strive to be a community that
welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities.
This includes, but is not limited to members of any race,
ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status,
social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual
orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family
status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical
ability.</li>
<li><strong>Be considerate.</strong> Your work will be used by
other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others.
Any decision you take will affect others, and you should take those
consequences into account when making decisions. Remember that,
broadly speaking, we're a global community, so you might not be
communicating in someone else's primary language.</li>
<li><strong>Be respectful.</strong> Not all of us will agree all
the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behaviour and poor
manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but
we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack.
It’s important to remember that a community where people feel
uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of
this Matrix room should be respectful when dealing with other
members, as well as with people in the wider Great Reset community
and beyond.</li>
<li><strong>Be careful in the words that you choose.</strong> We
are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves
professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other
participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behaviour aren't
acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:
<ul>
<li>Violent threats or language directed against another
person.</li>
<li>Discriminatory jokes and language.</li>
<li>Posting sexually explicit or violent material.</li>
<li>Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally
identifying information ("doxing").</li>
<li>Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist
terms.</li>
<li>Unwelcome sexual attention.</li>
<li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.</li>
<li>Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you
to stop, then stop.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>When we disagree, try to understand why.</strong>
Disagreements happen all the time, and our community will be no
exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and
differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different.
Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t
mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and
blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on
helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.</li>
</ul>
