<h1>&sect; A Beginning (2007)</h1>
<p>Johan tried to breathe normally. The tightness in his chest, the
shallow breathing, had settled upon him unnoticed again. He shook
his head in disgust. It wasn't like he had any reason to be
anxious. Sitting in his comfortable living room, surrounded by
silence, one could hardly imagine a more serene setting.</p>
<p>He got up from the couch, poring over the list of things he
needed to do today as he walked out to the front porch.</p>
<p>Clean the shower, have a shower, sort the recycling, buy some
eggs...</p>
<p>Johan's thoughts strayed from his list as he noticed the gravel
in the corners of the entryway. How long had it been since he'd
last swept and mopped the floor out here? He resolved to tackle
that before the shower; there was time.</p>
<p>A muffled shriek snapped his head up to the glass in the front
door. Out on the sidewalk, a young girl half-heartedly ran from two
young boys, a smile on her face as she again shouldered a bulging
knapsack that had come loose in a struggle. One of the boys still
had his arms outstretched in mock aggression, the grin on his face
matched by his cocky strut.</p>
<p>It wasn't until the children were beyond his hedges that Jonah
noticed his breathing had slowed again. He rolled his shoulders
back, breathing deeply as he tried to rid himself of the ire that
young boy's confidence had stirred in him.</p>
<p>"Where does such certainty come from?" he asked himself.</p>
<p>Jonah often spoke his thoughts aloud. He'd started doing it as a
child, and had discovered that even the most mundane thoughts took
on a conspiratorial edge when given voice. That illicit thrill was
still there. More importantly, Johan had come to rely on that voice
in his ears as a counterpoint in his reasoning; angels and demons
on his shoulders, helping him see his problems from all angles.</p>
