<h1>§ LAN troubleshooting, Part 2</h1>
<p>UPDATE: This has been fixed for a while now, but it took me a lot longer
to track down than I care to admit. The problem? The kit from my ISP used
the default network of 192.168.0.0/24, and OpenWRT uses 192.168.1.0/24 by
default. And I hadn't updated my ufw configuration. As soon as I did that,
presto! A working LAN. <em>sigh</em></p>
