Back from furlough \o/ shadowing colleagues now<br>
I want to get a Vault HA cluster up and running on my home
network:
<ul>
<li>I need a sandbox to play in and break things, so I don't
do it on client sites</li>
<li>I've re-purposed an old netbook, two old laptops and a
very old Dell desktop, now running LXLE and Xubuntu
respectively, to this end</li>
<li>I've also successfully bridged some LXD containers to
the LAN, to bolster numbers</li>
<li>I had been playing with Multipass, but I couldn't get
libvirt working, nor bridging as a result</li>
<li>Really happy with the runbook I'm putting together:
it's based on public tutorials, but also on the (currently)
private Vault CHIP bootcamp I completed recently</li>
</ul>
<span class="cmd">$&gt;cat ../.plan</span><br>
Thinking about using Cockpit to manage my containers, instead of LXC<br>
I still love Multipass:
<ul>
<li>Thinking about using it to host a Splunk indexer cluster with a search head cluster</li>
<li>I've upgraded my main desktop to 16GB of RAM; bet I could host a decent set-up without touching the LAN</li>
</ul>
Thinking about getting certified as a Linux system administrator:
<ul>
<li>Red Hat's scheme has been recommended</li>
<li>I'm also tempted by <a href=
"https://tanelpoder.com/seminar/practical-linux-performance-application-troubleshooting-training/">Tanel's course</a></li>
<li>And, serendipitously, <a href="https://www.linuxupskillchallenge.org/">this course on HN</a> (starts tomorrow!)</li>
</ul>
I want to write a comic book:
<ul>
<li>I've made a start at developing some storyboards</li>
<li>I've bought a Huion Inspiroy H950P drawing tablet to speed up prototyping</li>
</ul>
