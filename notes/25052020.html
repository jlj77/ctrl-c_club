<h1>&sect; 25/05/2020</h1>
<h2>(Bank Holiday) Monday</h2>
<p>Welcome! I'm Canadian, living and working in England. I've been
doing everything by the book, and, should all go as planned, I'll
be receiving permanent residency later this year. Fingers
crossed.</p>
<p>Like many of the lucky ones right now, I'm using a lot of my
work and personal time to learn new skills. I'm trained in computer
science, but that was a long time ago. I was a Linux (mostly Red
Hat)/Solaris sysadmin for a bit, but mostly I've just been running
Linux at home for 15 years or so -- Ubuntu, since early on,
largely; Mint these days, and LXLE on my netbook. (macOS at work
now.)</p>
<p>I'm training to be a Splunk Core Certified Consultant. I'm a
Certified Admin at the moment, going for Architect next month. I'm
also both a Hashicorp Terraform Associate and Vault Associate. (You
can validate all that through my <a href=
"http://linkedin.com/in/john-l-jarvis/">LinkedIn profile</a>, by
the way.) The job is still new -- I just passed my probation a few
weeks ago -- but at some point in the future, the idea is that I'll
be designing and implementing software deployments, mostly around
Splunk.</p>
<p>Other than that, I'm tinkering around with various projects,
squeezed in between being a dad to two very active children. I'm
blogging my learning as part of <a href=
"https://100daystooffload.com/">the 100 Days to Offload
project</a>, and, if I'm enjoying it as much as I am at the moment,
I'll continue well beyond that.</p>
