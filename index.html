Done my first Splunk PS now; I'm officially a consultant!<br>
I'm also certified as Professional (above Associate) with both
Terraform and Vault now!<br>
I finished the Linux Upskill Challenge! An excellent course. I
highly recommend it. As I write this, it's being offered each
month, for free, beginning on the first Monday of the month, IIRC.
Check out reddit for details.<br>
My Vault HA cluster is up and running:
<ul>
<li>I'm running two Vault nodes, one in an LXD container, and the
other on one of my old laptops.</li>
<li>It's backed by Consul, running on three nodes, each in another
LXD container.</li>
<li>The gossip key is now stored in Vault, and can be automatically
rotated.</li>
<li>All cluster traffic is encrypted over SSL, using certificates
generated by my intermediate CA (in Vault).</li>
<li>I'm also using the Transit Secrets Engine to auto-unseal
another Vault I have running as two nodes, each on other old
laptops. (One of those just failed yesterday, however. Gonna see
whether a hoover can revive it.)</li>
<li>All four containers are bridged on the LAN.</li>
<li>I'm running Telegraf on each of these nodes, sending metrics to
InfluxDB, running on my Xubuntu server.</li>
</ul>
I've then got Grafana running on my main workstation, with a few
different dashboards, monitoring Consul, Vault, telemetry from my
old laptops themselves, Jitsi, my broadband, etc.<br>
I'm running Jitsi Meet on my Xubuntu server as well. Let me know if
you'd like to use it for video conferencing!<br>
<ul>
<li>I'm still using LXC, because Jitsi's videobridge service uses
9090/tcp by default, meaning that Cockpit, in default
configuration, had to go.</li>
</ul>
<span class="cmd">$&gt;cat ../.plan</span><br>
I might revive Cockpit. But I'll probably try to get Splunk to
serve my monitoring needs, along with Grafana: then it's CPD
too.<br>
Multipass is still in the mix, but falling by the wayside. I've
picked up Docker now, because docker-splunk is just so simple and
powerful. It's jumped my troubleshooting game an order of
magnitude!<br>
I'm looking at docker-vault now too, for an upcoming demo.<br>
Oh, and docker-splunk has killed my desire to run any sort of
Splunk cluster natively; I've got an All-In-One instance on the
LAN, and that's enough, for playing.
<ul>
<li>I'm looking to replicate my Jitsi Meet dashboard, currently in
Grafana, in Splunk, for CPD.</li>
</ul>
The Consul Engineering Team have released an official Grafana
dashboard, backed by Prometheus. I want to translate this to one
backed by InfluxDB; an engineer suggested that translating PromQL
to IFQL is fairly straightforward.<br>
I want to start monitoring the expiry dates of all the certificates
I'm using in my environment.<br>
Also re Consul, I want to get ACLs working in a professional
manner:
<ul>
<li>So, more locked down than in my current runbook; and</li>
<li>In such a way that the associated tokens are automatically
rotated.</li>
</ul>
Also re CPD, I'm considering going for Consul Associate. I'll hold
off for a bit, though, as HashiCorp is in the middle of switching
exam proctors, as I understand it.
