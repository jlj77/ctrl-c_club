Done my first Splunk PS now; I'm officially a consultant!
I'm also certified as Professional (above Associate) with both Terraform and Vault now!
I finished the Linux Upskill Challenge! An excellent course. I highly recommend it. As I write this, it's being offered each month, for free, beginning on the first Monday of the month, IIRC. Check out reddit for details.
My Vault HA cluster is up and running:
- I'm running two Vault nodes, one in an LXD container, and the other on one of my old laptops.
- It's backed by Consul, running on three nodes, each in another LXD container.
- The gossip key is now stored in Vault, and can be automatically rotated.
- All cluster traffic is encrypted over SSL, using certificates generated by my intermediate CA (in Vault).
- I'm also using the Transit Secrets Engine to auto-unseal another Vault I have running as two nodes, each on other old laptops. (One of those just failed yesterday, however. Gonna see whether a hoover can revive it.)
- All four containers are bridged on the LAN.
- I'm running Telegraf on each of these nodes, sending metrics to InfluxDB, running on my Xubuntu server.
I've then got Grafana running on my main workstation, with a few different dashboards, monitoring Consul, Vault, telemetry from my old laptops themselves, Jitsi, my broadband, etc.
I'm running Jitsi Meet on my Xubuntu server as well. Let me know if you'd like to use it for video conferencing!
- I'm still using LXC, because Jitsi's videobridge service uses 9090/tcp by default, meaning that Cockpit, in default configuration, had to go.
